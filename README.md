# GoodChat App

GoodChat is an omni-channel chat solution that enables users to donate to us using their channel of choice (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, LINE, etc.).

This repository is for GoodChat App which is a hybrid app that provides a user interface that allows our staff to communicate with donors as well as generate structured transactions out of these interactions in order to integrate with our existing systems.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install dependencies using

```
npm install
```

### Running the application

```
npm start
```

This will start the react app.

## Development Guidelines

### GraphQL Development

**Type Generation**

We use [GraphQL code generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) to auto-generate types for use in our application.

Before running the code generator, make sure to set the required environment variables for it. You can refer to `.env.codegen.sample`

**Working with types and queries**

Write all your queries in `.graphql` or `.gql` files. Then wait for graphql code generator (which should be running in the background and watching for changes) to generate types and documents for you.
For example if you have a `myOffers.graphql` file like so

```
query myOffers {
  offers {
    id
    company_id
  }
}
```

The code generator would then generate a whole bunch of types, but most importantly it generates documents and hooks which we can import e.g.

```javascript
export const MyOffersDocument = gql`
  query myOffers {
    offers {
      id
      company_id
    }
  }
`;
```

This is an example of a generated document. According to [GraphQL Codegen Best Practices](https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-codegen-best-practices)

> You can manage your GraphQL operations in .graphql files, without worrying about loading it into your application with Webpack loaders ...
> ...automatically creates an executable copy (DocumentNode) of your GraphQL operations in the generated code file, and it will automatically include it within your wrapper call.

You can import it and use it in your project like so

```javascript
import { MyOffersDocument } from "generated/graphql";
```

You could also just directly import the generated hooks.
Thus instead of doing

```javascript
const { data } = useQuery < MyOffersQuery > MyOffersDocument;
```

you could do

```javascript
const { data } = useMyOffersQuery();
```

### Creating GraphQL mock responses

You can use Mock Service Worker to define mock responses. According to the [MSW docs for mocking GraphQL API:](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/mocks/graphql-api)

> Some GraphQL clients (i.e. Apollo) may require you to include the `__typename` property on each individual type on the mocked response:
>
> ```
>  ctx.data({
>    user: {
>      firstName: 'John',
>      lastName: 'Maverick',
>      __typename: 'User'
>    }
>  })
> ```
>
> Follow the response shape of your GraphQL client to ensure you produce a compatible mocked response.

A quick way to get this is by inspecting the graphql request on the Network tab in your browser developer tools and looking at the response.

### Testing

**Test isolation**

It is important to keep tests isolated and prevent them affecting other tests. We should be able to run tests in any order and they should still pass.

To prevent tests that write to localStorage from affecting other tests (and hence leading to non-isolated tests), there is a `localStorage.clear()` inside `setupTests.ts` that cleans up after every test.
You can put any other cleanup or setup logic here to maintain test isolation.

**Integration Tests**

Do not render `App` directly. As mentioned in the wiki entry on [Testing Routing](https://github.com/crossroads/app.goodchat.hk/wiki/Testing-Routing), `IonReactRouter` when used together with `IonRouterOutlet` behaves strangely in the test environment. Therefore, you should instead do something like this

```
const { container } = render(
  <IonApp>
    <AuthProvider>
      <Router history={history}>
        <MainRouter />
      </Router>
    </AuthProvider>
  </IonApp>
);
```

You could create an abstraction for this if you like, but the main point is that we use `Router` instead of `IonReactRouter` in tests.
